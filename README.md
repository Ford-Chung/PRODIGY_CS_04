# PRODIGY_CS_04
## Description

This repository contains a simple keylogger code in Python that records keystrokes and the time when they are pressed and saves it into a text file. The code utilizes the Pynput library to detect each key pressed. 
Note that this code is only for educational purposes and should not be used to conduct malicious activity.

## How to Use
1. To run the code in an integrated development environment(IDE) or in a terminal, use the following command.
```
python keylogger.py
```
2. Run the Code in the Background. Note that to end the program, you must go to the task manager, look for the Python process, and terminate it from there.
```
pythonw keylogger.py
```

## Requirements
<ul>
  <li> Python 3.X</li>
  <li> pynput</li>
</ul>
